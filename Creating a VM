#Using Cloud SDK - Cloud Build function

gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-central1-f

#to set compute zone/region

You can set the default region and zones that gcloud uses if you are always working within one region/zone and you don't want to append the --zone flag every time. To do this, run these commands:
gcloud config set compute/zone ...

gcloud config set compute/region ...
